          <p class="p">
            Explore Portugal Experience was created to offer private tours and transfers in Portugal that are,
            above all, human, calm and truly personalised.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            Every journey is planned with you: comfortable timings, clear pick-up points, room for good surprises,
            and real attention to your preferences — from itineraries and restaurants to photo stops.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            The goal is simple: you always feel safe, well looked after, and free to enjoy the journey instead of
            worrying about it.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            We work with solo travellers, families, small groups and professional partners (hotels, companies and operators),
            always with the same foundation: absolute respect for those who trust us.

          <div class="tribute-text">
            <p>
              Explore Portugal Experience was born from the dream and vision of someone extraordinary: Agapito,
              co-founder of this project, a certified professional driver, and a man guided by his passion for the road,
              the beauty of our country and meeting people from all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was Agapito who took the first step, who believed before everyone, who dreamed high without fear.
              His dedication, integrity, generosity and professionalism became the foundation of this company and defined
              who we are today: a service with soul, refinement and absolute respect for those who trust us.
            </p>
            <p>
              For him, driving was love. It was care. It was turning every journey into a human, calm and unforgettable experience.
              Those who had the privilege of travelling by his side know how his presence lit up every kilometre and every conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Agapito left too soon. But he never truly left.
              His legacy lives on in the road he started. It lives in every guest we welcome with attention and elegance.
              It lives in the way we honour detail, silence, comfort and the art of driving.
            </p>
            <p>
              With every trip, we continue what he began. With every destination reached, we carry him with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you, Agapito. Forever part of this home, forever at the wheel of our memories.
            </p>
